# CERS

CERS is a crowd sourced emergency reporting system, built to enable people share real time emergencies, across Nigeria using a simple offline-based USSD Interface.

The Emergency is immediately relayed to Response teams, Social media, and Local authorities and can be viewed through a real-time web dashboard.
